   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the console).

### Local Setup for Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

5. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Docker Setup Guide

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

2. From the root directory of the project, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. This will build and start both the frontend and backend services in containers.
